it would be good to fix the runner to support HHVM properly

and no, allowing failure on HHVM is not the right way

@stof huhu. I don't have HHVM installed on my laptop :( So it's not going to be easy to fix it. More over, it looks like it's a travis issue. Then, IMHO, HHVM support could be added into another PR.

-1 for the allowed failure. instead, you should fix https://github.com/sensiolabs/melody/blob/9ae5caac6da4049b01ca7a930ac556f1aba72786/src/SensioLabs/Melody/Runner/Runner.php#L39 to use the HHVM-compatible way to build the php executable. See the fix done in SensioDistributionBundle a while ago

@stof I'm going to merge this one because the HHVM support could and will be added by another PR. Then this PR really have to be merged to avoid [angry user](https://twitter.com/couac/status/541199680390963201) and to avoid [duplicate effort](https://github.com/sensiolabs/melody/pull/6)
