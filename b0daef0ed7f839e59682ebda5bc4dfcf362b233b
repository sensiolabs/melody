Hello.

What's the benefit ? there is more "code", and now, it's harder to reader / edit.

(I'm speaking of triple back-quote versus indent)

Actualy the website render code block based on those files and is not able to detect the language.
See the colorization of http://melody.sensiolabs.org/#btn_run-gists-scripts. It detect regexp in the url, and sometime the `$` is yellow, sometime, it's white.

An other solution could be to create a script on the webSite builder who adds triple back-quote just before renderer
