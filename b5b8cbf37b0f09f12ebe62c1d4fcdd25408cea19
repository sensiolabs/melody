Could you add a unit test?

Should the regex be more strict, so it allows only a shebang before the actual code?

@staabm Is there a reason to require that the script **must** start by `<?php` or `#!` ?

As the regex looks with this change melody would also run a script which is contained e.g. Within the contents of a blogpost etc..?

You're right, even if it is unlikely...What do you think @lyrixx ?

I'm not sure to understand everything here.
IMHO, the regex should be very strict, to avoid any weird side effect.

Add test and and enforce regexp
