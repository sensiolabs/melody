@lyrixx Hm, I am not sure if this change is not related to the failing tests (I am bit too unfamiliar with what all the tests do). What do you think?

@xabbuh : None of the failing tests are related to your changes. That's only due to Github's API rate limit and gists download.
We should probably create a user and token for those integration tests to work once #66 is ready.
