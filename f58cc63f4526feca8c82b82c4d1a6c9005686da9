`run` did not send an indicator to the caller whether the underlying processes worked correctly or not. maybe we should return a boolean in `Melody->run` ...?

Shouldn't `$cliExecutor` throws an exception when the called process failed ?

hmm you are right. Nevertheless I get sometimes into a state where the `WorkingDirectory` only contains a `bootstrap.php` file which then when executed produces a syntax-error, because of missing `vendor/autoload.php`...

Can you give steps to reproduce the bug?

Will be offline for a week and report back next week.

@jeremy-derusse I guess you can "blacklist" packagist by modifying your /etc/hosts to force an error in melody.
